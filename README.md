# Geometric-Distribution
I have to generate N number random variables using Geometric Distribution.Also have to show
the curve plotting the probability distribution and the curve plotting the observed frequency in
fraction (frequency/N)

Given,

parameter is p=0.5

First I have to take a random value between 0-1000 if N = 1000 .From that uniform random
number distribution we will get a value between 0 to 1.Using that random value in our
distribution we will get a value of x. From that we can get frequency distribution for variable x
which means how many times x occurred and from that can generate probability distribution and
compare it with theoretical.
